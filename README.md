# Clicky Game

Node JS React Memory Game

This project is a game created using the create-react-app boilerplate.

User's must click on any given image just once. If they click once they will earn one point. If they click on an image twice the game will be over and the score will be set back to zero.

## Highlights
- This game provides over a thousand of different images powered by the `picsum.photos API`.
- Every time a user visits the page will be presented with different a set of 16 images.
- After click once on every image of a given set, a new set will be loaded for the game to continue. This way the fun never stops.
- The page keeps track of the higher score for the current session.
